# Automating Crypto Website API Pull using Python

### Project Overview 

In this project, data will be taken from a crypto API and this process will be automated to track changes in cryptocurrencies over a period of time. The data will be appended to a CSV to allow data visualisations to be created. 

### Tools
- Jupyter Notebooks: python

### Steps
1. Import libraries
2. Pull in the data and nomalise.
3. Create a function so data can be pulled in automatically over a set amount of time.
4. Create CSV for the data to be appended to.
5. Run the function for a set amount of time to generate data.
6. Create data visualisations.

### Data Visualisations

#### Catplot

This visualisation shows the percent change in cryptocurrencies over a period of 90 days. XRP and TRON appear to have the largest rise in percentage change (over 20%) and the rest mostly stay round about the same or drop in value.

#### Line Graph

The following visualisation tracks the change in the price of Bitcoin over a period of time (7 minutes). There is a small drop in value after about 3 minutes then there is a larger increase in value after the 4/5 minute mark.
